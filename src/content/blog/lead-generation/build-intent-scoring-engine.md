Most lead generation systems fail at the same point: they generate volume without signal. A list of 10,000 contacts is not a lead generation asset. It is a noise problem. The operators who consistently close at higher rates are not sending more outreach; they are sending better-targeted outreach, to people who are already in motion toward a purchase decision.

An intent scoring engine is the infrastructure that makes this possible. It takes raw data about a prospect (behavioral signals, company signals, technographic signals), weights them against your ideal customer profile, and produces a numerical score that tells you who to contact, when, and with what message.

This is how you build one.

## What Intent Signals Actually Are

Intent signals are observable behaviors or data points that indicate a prospect is closer to buying than average. They are not demographic attributes (company size, industry, job title). Those are targeting filters, not intent signals. Intent is about timing and motion.

**Behavioral signals** (actions the prospect is taking right now):
- Visiting your pricing page multiple times in a week
- Downloading a lead magnet and returning to the site within 48 hours
- Engaging with competitor content on LinkedIn (trackable via tools like Bombora and G2)
- Posting questions in industry communities about problems your product solves

**Technographic signals** (what tools a company is using or recently adopted):
- Just deployed a new CRM (signals sales team growth, budget release)
- Added a specific technology to their stack that integrates with your offering
- Recently migrated away from a competitor's tool

**Firmographic signals** (changes in company structure that indicate buying capacity):
- Recent funding round (Series A/B companies are actively buying tools)
- Rapid headcount growth (signals budget expansion and operational strain)
- New executive hire in a relevant role (new VPs build their own stacks)
- Job postings for roles that your product serves

**Engagement signals** (interactions with your own content and channels):
- Email opens + link clicks within a defined window
- Webinar attendance
- Response to a cold email even if negative (indicates the problem is real)
- Social media engagement with your posts

The most valuable signals are those that indicate **urgency** (the problem is active right now) and **authority** (the person engaging has buying power or buying influence).

## Designing the Scoring Model

An intent scoring engine is a weighted attribute system. Each signal gets a point value, and the sum of a prospect's points produces their intent score. Prospects above a threshold enter your outreach sequence; those below stay in nurture or are deprioritized.

### Step 1 — Define your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Before assigning any weights, you need a precise ICP. This is not "mid-market SaaS companies." It is: B2B SaaS companies with 25–150 employees, ARR between $2M and $20M, a dedicated sales team of at least 3 people, currently using Salesforce or HubSpot, and showing signs of outbound sales investment.

The more specific your ICP, the more meaningful your scoring weights become. Vague ICPs produce scoring models that surface everyone and no one.

### Step 2 — Build your signal inventory

List every signal you can currently observe or acquire about a prospect. Organize them into the four categories above. Be honest about what data you actually have access to. A score built on signals you cannot reliably collect is theoretical, not operational.

### Step 3 — Assign weights

Weight signals by their correlation to conversion, not by how impressive they sound. High-weight signals (15–25 points) are strong indicators of near-term buying intent. Low-weight signals (1–5 points) provide context but alone mean little.

**Example scoring table:**

| Signal | Category | Points |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Pricing page visit (2+ times in 7 days) | Behavioral | 25 |
| Recent Series A/B funding | Firmographic | 20 |
| Hiring for a role your product serves | Firmographic | 18 |
| Competitor product review on G2 | Behavioral | 20 |
| New VP of Sales hired in last 90 days | Firmographic | 18 |
| Email opened + link clicked | Engagement | 12 |
| Tech stack includes your integration partners | Technographic | 15 |
| LinkedIn post about problem your product solves | Behavioral | 22 |
| Headcount growth 20%+ in 6 months | Firmographic | 15 |
| Downloaded lead magnet | Engagement | 8 |
| Webinar attendance | Engagement | 10 |
| Email opened, no click | Engagement | 3 |
| Job title match to ICP | Firmographic | 5 |
| Industry match to ICP | Firmographic | 3 |

### Step 4 — Set your threshold

Your scoring threshold determines who gets contacted. Set it too low and you are back to volume-based outreach. Set it too high and you miss good leads.

A practical starting framework:
- **0–30:** Do not contact. Nurture passively with content.
- **31–55:** Low intent. Monitor for signal changes, do not reach out yet.
- **56–79:** Medium intent. Add to a lower-priority sequence with longer delays.
- **80+:** High intent. Prioritize immediately, contact within 24–48 hours of score crossing threshold.

Your thresholds will shift as you calibrate against actual conversion data. Run the model for 30 days before changing the weights based on gut. You need data, not intuition, to optimize a scoring system.

## Building the Data Layer

The scoring model is only as good as the data feeding it. Here is how to construct the data layer from cheapest to most sophisticated:

**Level 1 — Manual + Spreadsheet (day one, zero budget).** Your CRM or a Google Sheet. Manually log signals for each prospect and score by hand. This is not scalable, but it forces you to understand which signals actually matter before you automate.

**Level 2 — Clay + Apollo/LinkedIn.** Clay is the highest-leverage tool for intent scoring at the growth stage. It pulls firmographic and technographic data, enriches contact records with 50+ data sources, and lets you build scoring logic with no-code formulas. Apollo provides contact data and some behavioral signals. At this level you can build a functioning automated scoring pipeline for under $300/month.

**Level 3 — Bombora + HubSpot/Salesforce.** Bombora tracks B2B intent signals across thousands of websites and surfaces companies showing elevated research activity on topics relevant to your offering. This is third-party behavioral intent data at scale. Expensive ($1,500–$3,000/month) but high signal. Worthwhile once you are past the early traction stage and have validated your ICP.

**Level 4 — Custom infrastructure.** Proprietary scrapers monitoring job boards, LinkedIn, company websites, and news sources. Enrichment APIs (Clearbit, PeopleDataLabs) for firmographic depth. A scoring engine built in Python or Node that runs on a cron job and pushes high-intent leads directly to your sales team's queue. This is what mature demand generation operations look like.

Most operators should be operating at Level 2 within their first 90 days. Level 3 comes when you are ready to scale outreach volume significantly and need predictive signal coverage.

## The Decay Function

Intent signals expire. A prospect who visited your pricing page 6 months ago is not a high-intent lead today. Build decay into your model. Every signal should have a half-life:

- Pricing page visit: high decay, 50% weight loss after 14 days
- Funding event: medium decay, relevant for 6–9 months
- New executive hire: medium decay, relevant for 3–6 months
- Email open: high decay, largely irrelevant after 30 days
- Tech stack adoption: low decay, remains relevant until the tool is replaced

This prevents your score from being dominated by historical data and keeps high-intent leads surfacing based on current behavior.

## Calibration and Iteration

After 60 days of running your scoring model, pull the data and run this analysis:
- Of all leads who scored 80+, what percentage converted to a sales conversation?
- Of all leads who scored 50–79, what percentage converted?
- Which individual signals are most correlated with conversion in your data?

Use these answers to reweight your model. The signals with the highest correlation to actual conversion should have the highest point values. Remove signals that are consistently present in low-converting accounts, as they are adding noise, not signal.

A well-calibrated intent scoring engine improves outreach-to-meeting conversion by 15–30% compared to unscored outreach to the same contact list. The math compounds: the same number of outreach messages, directed at higher-intent targets, produces materially more pipeline.

## What to Do When a Lead Scores High

Speed matters. When a prospect crosses your high-intent threshold, contact them within 24 hours. Research shows that lead response time is one of the highest predictors of conversion, not because urgency is inherently persuasive, but because a high-intent buyer is often evaluating multiple options simultaneously. The first credible outreach they receive has a disproportionate advantage.

Your outreach message should reference the specific signal that triggered the alert, and specifically, not generically. "I noticed you recently posted about [specific problem]" performs far better than a generic opening. The score tells you who to contact; the signal tells you what to say.

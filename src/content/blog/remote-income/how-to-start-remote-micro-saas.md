$10,000 per month in recurring revenue from a software product you built once and maintain part-time is not a fantasy. It is the business model of hundreds of solo founders and small teams operating right now, mostly invisibly, in niches you have never heard of. They are building tools for pool service companies, for orthodontists, for Shopify developers, for podcast editors, solving specific problems for specific people who will pay $50–$200/month to have that problem solved reliably.

Micro SaaS is the highest-leverage income vehicle available to a technical or semi-technical remote operator. The economics are structurally different from agency work, freelancing, or content creation. You build once. The product serves customers while you sleep. Revenue compounds as you add users rather than resetting each month. When combined with geo-arbitrage — operating in a low-cost market while selling to a US or European customer base — the effective wealth generation is disproportionate to the apparent size of the business.

This is how you build one.

## What Micro SaaS Is (And What It Is Not)

Micro SaaS is a narrowly focused software product serving a specific audience with a specific workflow problem, priced at $20–$500/month, built and operated by one to three people. It is not:

- A venture-backed startup pursuing a massive addressable market
- A platform trying to serve every possible user type
- A product that requires a sales team to close deals
- Something that needs to be built perfectly before it launches

The defining characteristics are **specificity** and **simplicity**. A good micro-SaaS does one thing extremely well for a clearly defined customer. It does not try to be everything. It does not need to be. The niche that makes most investors yawn ("too small, too specific") is exactly the niche that makes a micro-SaaS founder wealthy, because competition is low, customer acquisition is focused, and the product can be maintained by one person.

## The $10k/Month Math

$10,000/month MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) can be structured multiple ways:

| Pricing | Users Needed |
|---------|-------------|
| $49/month | 205 users |
| $99/month | 102 users |
| $199/month | 51 users |
| $499/month | 21 users |

51 users at $199/month is not an absurd goal. It is a specific, finite number of people who have a specific problem that your product solves. At that scale you are talking about a niche of perhaps 5,000–50,000 potential customers. Finding and converting 51 of them is a distribution problem, not a product problem.

The geo-arbitrage dimension changes the threshold for what this MRR means to your life. $10,000/month is an aggressive income target in New York. In Cebu, Philippines or Medellín, Colombia, it is generational wealth: a monthly surplus rate that funds asset accumulation at a pace that most Western professionals cannot match at twice the income.

## Niche Selection: The Most Important Decision

Most micro-SaaS products fail not because the code was bad but because the niche was wrong. The wrong niche has one or more of these characteristics:

- The problem is annoying but not painful enough to pay to solve
- The target customer does not have a budget or does not expect to pay for software
- The market is already served by a well-resourced competitor with a free tier
- The audience is too broad to reach through specific channels

The right niche has the opposite profile: the problem costs the customer more in time or money than your product costs, the customer is a professional or business that routinely buys software tools, and the market is specific enough to reach through focused channels (a specific community, conference, forum, or publication).

**The best niches to look for:**

**Underserved verticals.** Software built for dentists, veterinarians, property managers, food truck operators, boutique hotels. These markets have specific workflow problems that general tools do not solve, and they pay for software that does.

**Workflow glue between existing tools.** The integration that does not exist between two tools your target audience already uses. Companies will pay to eliminate manual data transfer between systems they are committed to.

**Automation of a specific recurring task.** A task that takes someone 3–5 hours per week to do manually, that could be automated reliably, and that the person doing it would happily pay $100/month to eliminate.

**Tooling for a specific professional community.** Tools built for Shopify developers, for podcast editors, for technical writers, for indie game developers. You can reach these communities directly and they are accustomed to buying niche tools.

The fastest path to good niche selection is spending time in communities where your target audience talks about their work. Reddit, Discord servers, Slack communities, industry forums. Listen for repeated complaints about specific workflows, manual processes, or missing tools. Every repeated complaint in a paid professional community is a potential micro-SaaS.

## Validation Before You Build

The most expensive mistake in micro-SaaS is building a product nobody pays for. Validation is the process of confirming demand before you spend weeks or months writing code.

**The validation standard:** 10 people have committed to paying you money for the product before it exists.

Not "I think this is a great idea." Not "my friend said this sounds useful." Ten people who have given you their credit card information, or signed a letter of intent, or paid a one-time founder access fee to be in the first cohort. This is the only signal that matters.

**How to get to 10 pre-sales:**

1. Write a one-page description of the product and the problem it solves. Post it in a relevant community with a clear CTA (early access waitlist or pre-order).
2. DM the people in that community who have complained about the specific problem your product addresses. Be direct: "I'm building [product] to solve [problem]. Would you pay $X/month for it if it worked as described? If yes, I'd love to get your card on file for early access."
3. Use cold email to reach professionals in the target niche with a landing page that has a pre-order button. If people click through but do not pre-order, your problem framing is off. If they pre-order, you have signal.

Ten pre-sales from cold outreach to strangers is genuine validation. Ten "this sounds interesting" responses from people you know is not.

## Build Stack by Skill Level

**No-code / low-code (fastest to launch, highest maintenance tradeoff):**
- Bubble for complex web applications with database logic
- Glide or Softr for simpler tools built on top of Airtable or Google Sheets
- Make (formerly Integromat) or Zapier for automation-heavy products

Advantages: launch in days or weeks, no deep engineering required. Disadvantages: scaling limits, performance ceilings, vendor dependency.

**Low-code with custom logic:**
- Supabase (database + auth + APIs) + Next.js or Remix (frontend)
- PlanetScale or Neon for serverless databases
- Vercel or Railway for hosting

This stack is accessible to developers with 6–12 months of experience and produces production-grade infrastructure that scales without ceiling. It is the current default for serious micro-SaaS founders who can code.

**Full custom:**
- Node.js or Python backend, PostgreSQL database, React or plain JS frontend
- Self-hosted on VPS (Hetzner is the cost-efficient choice) or cloud infrastructure
- Full control, maximum flexibility, highest maintenance overhead

Choose the lowest skill-level stack that can reliably deliver the product functionality you need. Over-engineering is a common failure mode in micro-SaaS. Spending six months building perfect infrastructure for a product with three paying users is a classic example.

## Pricing Strategy

Price on value delivered, not on your cost to build. The cost to serve a SaaS customer is largely fixed regardless of how much value they extract. Your hosting, your maintenance time, and your support overhead do not scale linearly with the value the customer receives.

**The most common micro-SaaS pricing mistakes:**
- Underpricing out of insecurity ("I don't want to charge too much for something this small")
- Monthly-only pricing (offer annual plans at 2 months free, which improves cash flow and reduces churn)
- Single flat price (tiered pricing captures more value from higher-usage customers)

A basic three-tier structure: a starter tier that covers your target individual user, a professional tier for power users or small teams, and a business tier for organizations. The business tier should be priced high enough that even one enterprise sale meaningfully impacts your MRR.

If you are unsure whether your price is right, raise it. Most early-stage micro-SaaS products are underpriced. You will know you are close to the right price when some people push back on it but still buy.

## Distribution: How You Get Your First 100 Users

The product is 40% of the work. Distribution is 60%. Most micro-SaaS products that fail do not fail because they were bad products. They fail because nobody found them.

**The channels that work for micro-SaaS:**

**Niche communities.** Post in the specific communities where your target customer spends time. Be genuinely useful in the community before you promote. A community member who has helped people for six months and then mentions their product gets 10x the engagement of a drive-by promotion.

**SEO.** For problems that people search for, organic search is the lowest-cost distribution channel with the best long-term economics. Write content that ranks for the specific keywords your target customer uses when they search for the problem your product solves. This is slow (6–12 months to see traction) but compounds indefinitely.

**Cold email to the ICP.** Use the intent scoring and personalized outreach frameworks covered in the Lead Generation pillar and apply them to micro-SaaS user acquisition. Identify companies where your ICP works and reach out directly.

**Product Hunt and similar launch platforms.** A successful Product Hunt launch produces a spike of early users and social proof. It is a one-time event, not a sustainable channel, but it bootstraps credibility and surfaces early power users who give disproportionately useful feedback.

**Integrations and partnerships.** If your product integrates with a larger tool, reach out to that tool's community, app marketplace, or partnership team. A listing in the HubSpot App Marketplace or Shopify App Store puts you in front of a qualified audience with established intent.

## The Maintenance Reality

Once you have 50–100 paying users, your primary job shifts from building to maintaining and improving. Expect 5–10 hours per week for customer support, bug fixes, and incremental feature development at this scale. This is why micro-SaaS is compatible with geo-arbitrage. A product generating $8,000/month in revenue requires a fraction of the active hours of a service business at the same revenue level.

Churn is the metric that determines whether your product compounds or stagnates. Monthly churn above 5% means you are leaking users faster than you can add them. Investigate churned users obsessively. The pattern in why people leave tells you more about what to build next than any feature request list.

The path to $10k/month is not a straight line. It is a sequence of: find the niche, validate the demand, build the minimum viable product, get to 10 paying users, iterate on feedback, get to 50, refine distribution, get to 100, systematize support, get to 200. Each stage has a different primary constraint. Navigate the stages in order rather than trying to solve all of them simultaneously.
